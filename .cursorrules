# Git Workflow Guidelines

- **DO NOT commit and push unless explicitly asked by the user**
  - Only run `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` when the user explicitly requests it
  - When showing changes or completing tasks, present the result without committing
  - Let the user decide when to commit and push their work

- **When user asks for commit/push:**
  - Always stage the specific files that were modified
  - Use descriptive commit messages that explain what changed
  - Ask for confirmation before pushing if not already requested
